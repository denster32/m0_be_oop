# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?  This was a tricky lesson.  The hobbit example took some time to figure out.  
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? I got a really early start this morning so that I could read ahead and get a handle on things.  That has been very helpful today.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need? I probably need to start exercising in the morning to get the blood flowing.
